🚀 Introducing My Snake Slash Game! 🎮 🚀

I’m excited to share my latest project, a Snake Slash game built from scratch using C++ and the raylib game development library! 🐍🎉

This project is a personal achievement that combines my passion for game development with a deeper understanding of programming fundamentals. Here’s what I learned along the way:

🔥 Mastering C++: Developing this game was a hands-on journey through key C++ concepts, from memory management to optimization.
💡 Working with raylib: I explored the raylib library, which provided a simple and powerful way to handle graphics, input, and sound for the game.
🧠 deque Data Structure: Implemented the snake's movement using the deque data structure for efficient rendering of the dynamic body segments.
🎮 Core Game Concepts: Gained a deep understanding of core game mechanics like the game loop, collision detection, and memory management to ensure smooth gameplay.
This project taught me how to create a fully functional game with well-organized code and optimized performance, paving the way for future development challenges!

👉 Check out the game and let me know what you think! This is just the beginning of my journey into game development. 🚀
